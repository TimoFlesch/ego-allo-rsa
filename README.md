# RNN simulations with egocentric vs allocentric reference frames

## Overview
This project investigates if and how a recurrent neural network can encode and transform between allocentric and egocentric reference frames, both in its inputs and outputs.
## Getting started
clone the repository, navigate to its main folder and install the package via:
```
pip install -e . --user
